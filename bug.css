The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is less specific than the p rule */
}
```

In this example, the `div p` selector has lower specificity than the `p` selector. As a result, the text color of paragraphs within a div will be red, not green, due to inheritance.  This can lead to unexpected styling if you aren't carefully considering specificity.

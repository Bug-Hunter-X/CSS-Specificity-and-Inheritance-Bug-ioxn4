The solution is to increase the specificity of the `div p` selector to ensure it overrides the `p` selector. Here's how:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /* Increased specificity using the child combinator */
}
```

By using the child combinator (`>`), the selector now specifically targets only paragraph elements that are direct children of div elements. This ensures that the intended styling is applied, resolving the inheritance conflict.
